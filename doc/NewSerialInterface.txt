* PRELIMINARY EMERGENCY DOC *

  New serial interface funcions:

    h = Mount()                -- creates a serial object; 0 = ERROR; >0 = handle of the object
    r = UnMount(handle)        -- delets the serial object "handle"
    r = CheckPort(handle,port) -- checks if COM port number "port" is available (on "handle")
    r = Open(handle, port)     -- opens COM port number "port" on handle "handle"
    r = Close(handle)          -- closes the opened COM port on handle "handle"
    r = SendByte(handle, byte) -- sends a byte over the COM port reference by handle "handle"
    n = BufferCount(handle)    -- counts the number of bytes in the receive buffer of "handle"
    r = Config(handle,         -- configures the COM port referenced by "handle":
               baud,           -- baud rate (300..3000000 bits/s)
               bits,           -- number of bits (5, 6, 7, 8)
               parity,         -- parity (0, 1, 2 -> NONE, ODD, EVEN)
               stop)           -- number of stop bits (1, 2)
    n = ReadByte(handle)       -- read a byte from the reiceive buffer ( <0 = EMPTY; >=0 = byte)
    r = BufferFlush(handle)    -- empty the receive buffer
